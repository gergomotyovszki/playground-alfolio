I am an economist at the European Commission's DG ECFIN, working on macroeconomic modelling. I defended my PhD at the Department of Economics of the European University Institute in Florence, Italy.

My research interests lie in the fields of Monetary Economics and International Macroeconomics, focusing on the interaction of monetary-fiscal policies and household heterogeneity in open economies and currency unions.

Prior to my PhD, I worked at the monetary strategy division of the central bank of Hungary, as well as at OGResearch, a macroeconomic consultancy involved in macro forecasting for developing countries. I have spent my PhD internships at the Bank of England and the European Central Bank, and I was a visiting researcher at the University College London.

I hold an MA degree in Economics from the Central European University in Budapest. I spent an Erasmus semester attending Macroeconomics courses at the Universiteit van Amsterdam. I was also a member of the Rajk László College in Budapest during my university studies. 

You can find my research [here](/playground-alfolio/research/), and can download my CV [here](/playground-alfolio/assets/pdf/cv_motyo.pdf).
